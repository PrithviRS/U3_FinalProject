# Clusters
by Prithvi Subrahmanyam.

Created as final project for unit 3 of Creative Coding.

<h2>Description</h2>

This project is a piece of art that progressively becomes more organised. I wanted this to reflect some of my personal struggles with a lack of time management. I feel that this project resonates with me deeply because of the gradual change that takes place over time.

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

My inspiration for this project came some of my older work, but also some of the projects that Mr. Linus showed me and some sketches on OpenProcessing (A collection of works made in processing.)

I see this art as a very simplified version of what I'd like to be able to do. Hopefully I can continue on this project, and add in a lot more types or styles of art.
